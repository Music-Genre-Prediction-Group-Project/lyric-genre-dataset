# Introduction

The datasets with genre and lyric data.

The datasets were generated by creating an intersection between the musiXmatch dataset (Lyric Data) and the tagtraum genre annotations (Genre Labels).

- **msd-track-id** is the million song dataset track id
- **genre** is the genre label provided by tagtraum cd2c
- **lyric_data** is comma-separated values in the form of <word-id>:<count> such that
  - **word-id** is the 1-indexed position of the word in word-ids-index-1.txt
  - **count** is the number of times that word appears in the lyrics
