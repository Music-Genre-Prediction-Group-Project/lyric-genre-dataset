# Introduction

The datasets with genre and lyric data.

_genly datasets_ are balanced by genre. The suffixes 1k, 2k, and 3k represent 1000, 2000, and 3000 samples respectively of each genre in that dataset. If a genre had fewer occurrences than that number, it is omitted from the dataset.

The datasets were generated by creating an intersection between the musiXmatch dataset (Lyric Data) and the tagtraum genre annotations (Genre Labels).

## Format

genre_lyric_dataset.csv, genre_lyric_train.csv and genre_lyric_test.csv contain no headers. Each line is the format of <msd-track-id>,<genre>,...<lyric_data> where:

- **msd-track-id** is the million song dataset track id
- **genre** is the genre label provided by tagtraum cd2c
- **lyric_data** is comma-separated values in the form of <word-id>:<count> such that
  - **word-id** is the 1-indexed position of the word in word-ids-index-1.txt
  - **count** is the number of times that word appears in the lyrics
